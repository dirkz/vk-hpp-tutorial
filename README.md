# Vulkan Tutorial, C++ style

Let's do the official [Vulkan Tutorial](https://docs.vulkan.org/tutorial/latest/00_Introduction.html),
but with pure [Vulkan-Hpp](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/Vulkan-Hpp).

I think it will be a lot of fun, and may be even yield code that can be used as a base
for a decent vertex pipeline for other projects.
